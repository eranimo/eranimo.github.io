title: Another attempt at a blog

This is my second attempt at a personal blog, let's see how it goes. I always have a lot to write about, lots of ideas and things to rant about -- but very little *drive* to actually write. Besides web development, I don't really contribute to the web in the normal sense. I'm always a lurker, but I'm trying to change that.

This time I got creative and installed a more up-to-date blogging platform. [Ghost](http://ghost.org) is a new blogging project built using Node.js. It has an as awesome admin panel, something that I find very important. The installation was a bit rough around the edges, especially after a two month hiatus from Node.js development.

Let's see how it goes!
