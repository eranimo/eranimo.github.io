Most of my web projects throughout the years have been in some way game related. Those have included numerous Flash game websites, gaming forums, reference websites, and even a review website. I’ve always been really good at working for weeks or months on a new website and then abandoning it.</p>
<p>Around 2009 the web started to really mature enough for me to contemplate making an entire game using my web development skills. I didn’t want to write a Flash game because they typically catered to a more casual audience and were by necessity smaller than other mediums. But why not make the entire website the game?</p>
<p>I liked the idea of online multiplayer games where you only play for a few minutes (or hours) a day, but the game world is persistent and things can happen when you’re not playing. A good example of a game that (somewhat) successfully did this is <a href="http://www.ogame.org" target="_blank" rel="external">OGame</a>.</p>
<p>So around 4 years ago I started building a clone of OGame written in PHP and MySQL called <strong>PrimaNova</strong>. I had most of the features working, and I even had a few people playing it. I wanted more features, so I rewrote the game from scratch many times over the years, switching from PHP to Node and now Python. Now it bears very little resemblance to OGame, at least on paper.</p>
<h3 id="The_Game"><a href="#The_Game" class="headerlink" title="The Game"></a>The Game</h3><p>What is the game about? Ok, are you sitting down? Good.<br>It’s a massively multiplayer online browser-based real-time grand strategy game with a science fiction theme set in space. Think Civilization meets Europa Universalis, but set in space. Whew!</p>
<p>The player takes on the role of the leader in a space faring society just starting to explore and colonize space. One of the goals I have for this game is to be immersive, even if it’s just a browser game. Lacking pretty 3D graphics, the best way to do this is by telling a story. One of my many sub-projects of this game is developing a way to intelligently create a procedurally generated story based on input from the player and the AI.</p>
<p>At it’s core, the game is a classic empire building game. Players can construct buildings and ships, gather and exploit resources, manage their population, explore a huge galaxy, and attack or work with other players. Players can send colony ships to other planets and moons to expand their empire and capture valuable resources.</p>
